/**
 * JFavicon is a simple library for finding the URLs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicons</a>.
 * <p>
 * The correct way for a page to define its favicon is with a link element in the head. However, not all pages do this,
 * so if there are no link elements, the root is checked for files like {@code favicon.ico} (see
 * {@link com.zachklipp.jfavicon.Source} for which extensions are checked).
